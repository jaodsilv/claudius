I want to create a few guidelines based on the content of files.
The guidelines will be used to create content to be used in claude code, such as agents, commands, output styles, prompts, system prompts, etc.

The guidelines I want to create are:

- Custom Slash Commands Creation
- Sub-Agents Creation
- Output Styles Creation
- Claude Code Hooks Creation
- Python Agents using Claude Code SDK
- Python Agents using Anthropic SDK
- Claude Code prompt writing
- Sub-Agents Benchmarking
- Prompts Benchmarking

Your task is to create an extensive list of tags that mark the content of the files
so I can easily find and filter which files to use for each guideline.
